a dog runs quickly.
a star twinkles in the sky.
a man reads a book.
the bird sings a song.
the children play a game.
the cat chases the mouse.
an algorithm solves a complex problem.

a student asked a question.
tall trees sway gently in the breeze.
the sun rises over the calm sea.
the cat quickly jumps over the small fence.
a boy writes a letter to a dear friend.
the chef cooks food in the kitchen.
the dog happily runs around the big yard.
the boat sails smoothly across the blue lake.
the old man walks in the park.
the girl saw a cat.
