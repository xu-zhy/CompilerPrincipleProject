> Papadimitriou et al.-2020-Brain computation by assemblies of neurons

# Project:

The project operation, denoted as project(x, B, y), involves activating an assembly x while a target area B is disinhibited. This results in the formation of a new assembly y in B. Repeated activation of x leads to the gradual selection of cells in 𝐵 based on synaptic weights, which eventually converge to form y​.

# Associate:

The association operation involves two assemblies x and y in different areas being projected into a third area. When the parent assemblies fire simultaneously, neurons from each assembly migrate to the other, creating overlap between the assemblies. This overlap can reach up to 8-10% due to the association​​.

# Completion:

Pattern completion involves the activation of a subset of neurons in an assembly leading to the activation of the entire assembly. This process is reinforced by repeated firing, which ensures that even a small subset can recover nearly all of the original assembly​​.

# Merge:

The merge operation is complex and involves creating a new assembly that integrates two separate assemblies x and y. This is done by simultaneous spiking of the parent assemblies, which induces the firing of x and y. This process involves afferent computations between different brain areas, resulting in a new assembly xy that has strong synaptic connections to both x and y​.
